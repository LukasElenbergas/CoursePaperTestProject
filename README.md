# Test Unity Project For Course Paper

A Unity project intended to be used for making automated builds using Docker. Builds are created for 3 selected platforms - Linux, macOS and Windows - are kept on their separate build branches together with their respective build logs. The README.md files contained in these branches contain the history of successfull/ failed builds.

The Unity project itself is a downsized reacreation of the first Super Mario Bros level. Feel free to download a build of it for your preferred OS from the respective branch.
